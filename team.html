              Martin Barisits is a CERN staff member and since 2017 the project leader for the scientific data
              management system Rucio. In his role he focuses on the evolution of the software architecture to meet
              the needs of ATLAS data taking during HL-LHC, as well as the needs of other scientific experiments using
              Rucio. An ATLAS member for more than 10 years, he worked in ATLAS computing in different roles, where he
              focused on leading the design and development of distributed systems. He is one of the architects of the
              distributed data management system Rucio. Martin holds a PhD degree in computer science and a MSc degree
              in computational intelligence, both from the Vienna University of Technology.

	    Hugo González Labrador is a Storage Engineer who has been working on large distributed tape and disk storage systems since he joined CERN in 2013. Prior to his time at CERN, he developed ground-station software for the <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/humsat-d.htm">HumSAT ESA project</a>. Hugo is a strong advocate for open-source technologies, with Go being his favorite programming language. He co-organized the <a href="https://gohack.devpost.com/">largest Go hackathon in the world</a>. In 2024, Hugo joined the Rucio development team and is part of the data management teams of both ATLAS and CMS experiments. His goal is to streamline best practices and promote the adoption of Rucio among other experiments.
In his spare time, Hugo enjoys technical diving in cold lakes and restoring classic cars. He holds an MSc in Computer Engineering from the University of Vigo.

              Delft, joined CERN in June 2024 to enhance Rucio. As part of the
              <a href="https://dafab-ai.eu/" target="_blank">DaFab AI project</a>, Dimitris will extend Rucio’s
              capabilities to support Earth Observation data, marking its expansion beyond high-energy physics data. This
              entails new metadata capabilities for Rucio along with enhanced discovery mechanisms. In this role,
              Dimitris becomes a lead deputy for the Metadata component and lead for Rucio's Database. In his spare
              time, you might find Dimitri exploring new horizons on his motorcycle.
